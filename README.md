Todo is a React Native App that uses native elements to add items to a todo list, mark items as complete. Todo also features a button to remove completed items from the list.

## Key Features

#### Native Components

MortalNote implements ReactQuill, a React Component that wraps around the popular Quill.js library. This allows for Rich Text Editing in all of the user's notes. 

##### View

The `View` is similar to the `div` in web development. There is also the `ScrollView` in case the information in the view is greater than the size of the screen. 

##### Text

The `Text` component is React Native's way to display words and symbols on the smartphone. 

##### FlatList

The `FlatList` allows a programmer to display lists *[arrays]* of data in React Native. The `FlatList` scrolls; the `FlatList` is smart and only renders the components shown on the current screen.

##### Switch

The `Switch` component is a React Native element that has built-in animations to differentiate and display the value of a boolean: **true** or **false**. 

## Future Features

#### Multiple Screens

I want to learn how to use the navigator for React Native. I will add a priorities screen to learn the nuances of navigation between screens in React Native.

#### Animations
I want to add an animation where the todo item fades into oblivion upon deletion. 

#### Custom Checkbox

I want to implement a custom checkbox for completed notes, rather than the built in React Native `Switch` Component. 

#### Add Code Snippets to ReadME

I will add code snippets under the key feature sections.
